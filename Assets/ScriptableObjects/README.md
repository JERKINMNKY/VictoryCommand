Assets/ScriptableObjects â€” Canonical ScriptableObject assets

This folder is intended to hold canonical ScriptableObject asset instances for buildings and game data. In this project we prefer using `Assets/Resources` for easy runtime access during development.

If you add assets here:
- Keep naming consistent and avoid duplicates.
- Use the City Tile Editor to reference these assets where appropriate.
