Assets/Resources/Cities — CityData assets

This folder stores `CityData` assets. The project includes a sample `CityData.asset` used for editor testing and prototyping.

When adding a new city asset:
- Use `Assets → Create → IFC → CityData` (if you have a CreateAssetMenu entry)
- Ensure `cityTiles` and `resourceTiles` lists are the right size (use the City Tile Editor 'Ensure Tiles Size' button)

Do not commit large or temporary debug assets unless they are part of the game's content.
