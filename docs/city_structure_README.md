## ‚ö†Ô∏è Developer Notes

- Future expansions may introduce additional buildings like Radar, Intel, Superweapons Facility, or Trade Port.
- Ultra Converter will consume **Dark Energy** as an exclusive resource from capital cities or anomalies.
- Each category is implemented as a separate folder in Unity (e.g., `Assets/Scripts/Buildings/Management`).
