# Next Steps

Layer focus: Core Simulation | Life Domains: Autonomy, Security, Logistics

1. **Officer Effects** — model mayor and wall officer bonuses impacting morale, build slots, and production.
2. **Queue Persistence** — persist build/training progress across sessions with JSON save/export.
3. **Combat & Raids** — prototype defensive battle resolution that consumes wall HP and troops.
4. **Economy Balancing** — replace placeholder production rates with authoritative War 2 Victory tables.
5. **UI Hooks** — expose tick summaries in Unity UI to visualize the loop without relying on console logs.
