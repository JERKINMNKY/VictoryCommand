docs — Design notes and prompts

This folder contains design notes and prompt artifacts used while prototyping. It is not authoritative documentation — prefer to use the README files in `Assets` for in-repo guidance.

Typical contents:
- city_structure_README.md — high level design notes about city tiles and layout
- prompts/ — experimental prompts and AI-generated text

Please keep docs small and focused; use issues/PRs for larger design discussions.
