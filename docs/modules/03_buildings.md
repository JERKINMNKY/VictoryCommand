# Building Construction & Upgrades

Core building types and behaviors, including prerequisites, blueprint gating, concurrent build slots, and acceleration via premium items.

Considerations:
- Cost and time scaling
- Build queue management
- Effects per level (storage, labor, production)

Reference: See `docs/modules/entities.md` for the Building schema and `docs/modules/12_roadmap.md` for implementation phases.
